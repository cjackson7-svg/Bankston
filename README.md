# Bankston’s Sports Memorabilia, Comics & Collectibles — Website Redesign
Modern, responsive redesign of a local sports memorabilia and collectibles shop website.  
Created as part of my Web Design & Development coursework, this project focuses on layout improvement, brand consistency, usability, and responsive structure.

## Project Overview
Bankston’s is a retro-style comics, collectibles, and sports memorabilia store.  
The original website lacked modern structure, visual consistency, and a clear navigation system.

This redesign focuses on:

- Updated branding and color scheme  
- Cleaner, more organized navigation  
- Enhanced product category presentation  
- Better use of imagery  
- Increased readability and spacing  
- Improved first-time user flow  

The goal was to make the site feel bold, energetic, and modern while still aligning with the existing store identity.
