            <p>
            For more than forty years, the Bankston family has carried forward a legacy built on dedication, hard work, and a genuine passion for serving the community. The story begins in the early 1970s, when Rodney and Kay Bankston opened a small tire and appliance shop. What started as a practical family business soon grew into something much larger as their sons, Brent and Brad, showed an early interest in following their parents’ entrepreneurial path. Wanting to build something meaningful for his boys to inherit, Rodney laid the foundation for what would eventually become a major name in Texas collectibles culture. In 1985, that vision took form with the opening of Bankston’s Used Books. What first appeared to be a simple bookstore quickly evolved into a destination for booming hobbies like comic books and sports cards. Under Brent and Brad’s leadership, the store expanded and adapted to rising customer interest and national trends. Over the years, Bankston’s Sports Cards & Comics maintained its reputation for friendly service, expertise, and community connection. The family’s influence even extended beyond Waco with the growth of Austin Books & Comics, which carried the same values and customer-first approach. Today, the Bankston legacy remains strong through a multigenerational dedication to comics, collectibles, and authentic customer care.
